# C# Style Guide
C# Style Guide for Tutorials

---
The code is read much more often than it is written.


### The Zen of any programming language

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Flat is better than nested.
* Sparse is better than dense.
* Readability counts.
* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
* Although practicality beats purity.
* Errors should never pass silently.
* Unless explicitly silenced.
* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
* There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
* Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
* Now is better than never.
* Although never is often better than *right* now.
* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
* Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!



You also see "Readability Counts" in the above listed points, which should be your main concern while writing code: other programmers should understand and should be able to contribute to your code so that it can solve the task at hand.


## Style Guiding Principles

* Be consistent.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate, not just when you like it.
* Assume your reader knows C# and English.
* Prefer clarity to 'performance'.
* Prefer clarity to .NET dogma.
* Write comments that people want to read, with correct spelling and grammar.


## The Rundown

* Indent with tabs.
* Max line length is 100 columns.
* Use spaces and empty lines precisely.
* Braces generally go on their own lines.
* Never put a space before `[`.
* Always put a space before `{`.
* Always put a space before `(` except for method invocations or when following another `(`.

## Nomenclature

On the whole, naming should follow C# standards.

### Namespaces

Namespaces are all **PascalCase**, multiple words concatenated together, without hypens ( - ) or underscores ( \_ ):

**BAD**:

```csharp
com.raywenderlich.fpsgame.hud.healthbar
```

**GOOD**:

```csharp
RayWenderlich.FpsGame.Hud.Healthbar
```

### Classes & Interfaces

Written in **PascalCase**. For example `RadialSlider`. 

### Methods

Methods are written in **PascalCase**. For example `DoSomething()`. 

### Fields

All non-static fields are written **camelCase**. Per Unity convention, this includes **public fields** as well.

For example:

```csharp
public class MyClass 
{
    public int publicField;
    int packagePrivate;
    private int myPrivate;
    protected int myProtected;
}
```

**BAD:**

```csharp
private int _myPrivateVariable
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
private int myPrivateVariable
```

Static fields are the exception and should be written in **PascalCase**:

```csharp
public static int TheAnswer = 42;
```

### Parameters

Parameters are written in **camelCase**.

**BAD:**

```csharp
void DoSomething(Vector3 Location)
```
**GOOD:**

```csharp
void DoSomething(Vector3 location)
```

Single character values are to be avoided except for temporary looping variables.

### Delegates

Delegates are written in **PascalCase**.

When declaring delegates, DO add the suffix **EventHandler** to names of delegates that are used in events. 

**BAD:**

```csharp
public delegate void Click()
```
**GOOD:**

```csharp
public delegate void ClickEventHandler()
```  

DO add the suffix **Callback** to names of delegates other than those used as event handlers.

**BAD:**

```csharp
public delegate void Render()
```
**GOOD:**

```csharp
public delegate void RenderCallback()
```  

### Events

Prefix event methods with the prefix **On**.

**BAD:**

```csharp
public static event CloseCallback Close;
```  

**GOOD:**

```csharp
public static event CloseCallback OnClose;
```

### Misc

In code, acronyms should be treated as words. For example:

**BAD:**

```csharp
XMLHTTPRequest
String URL
findPostByID
```  

**GOOD:**

```csharp
XmlHttpRequest
String url
findPostById
```

## Declarations

### Access Level Modifiers

Access level modifiers should be explicitly defined for classes, methods and member variables.

### Fields & Variables

Prefer single declaration per line.

**BAD:**

```csharp
string username, twitterHandle;
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
string username;
string twitterHandle;
```

### Classes

Exactly one class per source file, although inner classes are encouraged where scoping appropriate.

### Interfaces

All interfaces should be prefaced with the letter **I**. 

**BAD:**

```csharp
RadialSlider
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
IRadialSlider
```

## Spacing

Spacing is especially important in raywenderlich.com code, as code needs to be easily readable as part of the tutorial. 

### Indentation

Indentation should be done using **spaces** â€” never tabs.  

#### Blocks

Indentation for blocks uses **4 spaces** for optimal readability:

**BAD:**

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
{
  Debug.Log("index=" + i);
}
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
{
    Debug.Log("index=" + i);
}
```

#### Line Wraps

Indentation for line wraps should use **4 spaces** (not the default 8):

**BAD:**

```csharp
CoolUiWidget widget =
        someIncrediblyLongExpression(that, reallyWouldNotFit, on, aSingle, line);
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
CoolUiWidget widget =
    someIncrediblyLongExpression(that, reallyWouldNotFit, on, aSingle, line);
```

### Line Length

Lines should be no longer than **100** characters long.

### Vertical Spacing

There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity 
and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but 
having too many sections in a method often means you should refactor into
several methods.


## Brace Style

All braces get their own line as it is a C# convention:

**BAD:**

```csharp
class MyClass {
    void DoSomething() {
        if (someTest) {
          // ...
        } else {
          // ...
        }
    }
}
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
class MyClass
{
    void DoSomething()
    {
        if (someTest)
        {
          // ...
        }
        else
        {
          // ...
        }
    }
}
```

Conditional statements are always required to be enclosed with braces,
irrespective of the number of lines required.

**BAD:**

```csharp
if (someTest)
    doSomething();  

if (someTest) doSomethingElse();
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
if (someTest) 
{
    DoSomething();
}  

if (someTest)
{
    DoSomethingElse();
}
```
## Switch Statements

Switch-statements come with `default` case by default (heh). If the `default` case is never reached, be sure to remove it.

**DEFAULT GETS USED:**  
  
```csharp
switch (variable) 
{
    case 1:
        break;
    case 2:
        break;
    default:
        break;
}
```

**DEFAULT DOESN'T GET USED:**  
  
```csharp
switch (variable) 
{
    case 1:
        break;
    case 2:
        break;
}
```

## Language

Use US English spelling.

**BAD:**

```csharp
string colour = "red";
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
string color = "red";
```
